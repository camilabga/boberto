# Boberto: 2019 IEEE Open Robot Competition

Boberto was a robot developed by six students of LAR-UFRN (https://github.com/lar-ect). The competition consisted in proposing, developing and manufacturing a robot able to solve a portuary challenge.

2019 IEEE Open was a part of LARC (Latin American Robotics Competition) and happened in Rio Grande, RS, Brazil. The robot described here accomplished the second place, but is also currently the double Brazilian champion in the category.

The main goal was deposit as much containers as possible in a enviroment with a simulation of two ships (one blue and other green) and one train (red). Each container had a different pontuation. The team with the greatest score would win the challenge.

Boberto was able to:
1. Identify and advance to a container zone;
2. Choose a container to pick and check its color;
3. If it consisted in a Blue/Green container, grab it and go to the ship zone;
4. If it consisted in a Red container, ignore it and keep moving to the next pile;
5. Come back and do it all over again;
